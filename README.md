# MUMT501_final_project
This repository contains the source code (`demo.py`), the data (under `MIR-1K` folder) and the results (under `result` folder) for the project "pYIN: A Fundamental Frequency Estimator". 

In order to run the code, you need to first clone the repository and install the required package from `requirements.txt`. When you run `python demo.py`, it will estimate f0 for all the male singers (without `geniusturtle`). If you have a python IDE (e.g., Pycharm), you will see the plot of the ground truth f0 and the estimated one for each clip, and all the statistics of the results are saved as a `.txt` file within `result` folder.

Let me know if you have any questions: yaolong.ju@mail.mcgill.ca!
